These are really loose notes, intended for collaborators (although they are public)

Overview
========

We have a lot of potential generation-based projects and we need to get them _out_:

* filtered means (a very mathy version, dropped from generation_links)

* generation_links is at least a MS

* speed and strength (presented first in Clearwater)

* spatio-temporal stuff
	* A lot of directions to go with this
	* JD keeps wanting to get the theory out "first" but SWP points out this could take forever. We should work on applied papers, maybe in parallel

Possible examples:
==================

* What if we apply the temporal correction to the Ebola epidemic?

* Where can we get data that would allow us to play with temporal corrections?

Spectrum: theory ⇒ applied methods tested on fake data ⇒ real date

Temporal correction
-------------------

We've been thinking about how to generate CIs for temporal corrections

Presumably there's a likelihood approach, we should try to develop that. Consistent with the gamma approach? or should we be moving away from parametric stuff?

We also have at least three different ideas of how we might bootstrap this:
* conventional (resample, then weight); conservative (subsample, then weight); weighted sampling (followed by unweighted mean)

GI fitting
----------

DC is doing good work, but we probably need a clearer question: estimating parameters simply from observed GIs is probably impossible.
